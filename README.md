# ERMate

Visual database schema designer for developers. Design ER diagrams, define tables and relationships, and share via URL — no backend required.

## Features

- **Visual canvas** — drag-and-drop tables on an interactive grid with zoom, pan, and fit-to-view
- **Tables & columns** — create tables with default columns (id, created_at, updated_at); add columns with types (VARCHAR, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, TEXT, TIMESTAMP) and constraints (PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
- **Relationships** — connect columns visually to define one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
- **Junction tables** — auto-generate junction tables with foreign keys for many-to-many relationships
- **Export** — download schemas as JSON or generate SQL DDL (CREATE TABLE + ALTER TABLE with foreign keys)
- **Import** — load schemas from previously exported JSON files
- **Share via URL** — generate compressed shareable links with the full schema embedded in the URL hash
- **Auto-save** — changes are automatically saved to localStorage after 1 second of inactivity
- **Undo/redo** — full undo history for schema changes (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- **Validation** — validate schemas for errors and warnings
- **Dark mode** — toggle between light and dark themes, persisted across sessions
- **PWA** — installable as a standalone app with offline support via service worker

## Data Storage

All data lives in the browser — no server, no database.

- **Schemas** are stored in `localStorage` under the key `ermate:schemas`
- **Theme preference** is stored under `ermate:theme`
- **Shared schemas** are encoded in the URL hash (`#schema=...`) using LZ-String compression
- **PWA cache** is managed by Workbox for offline access
